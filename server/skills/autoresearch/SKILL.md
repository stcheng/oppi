# Autoresearch

Autonomous experiment loop: try ideas, keep what works, discard what doesn't, never stop.

## Tools

- **`init_experiment`** — configure session (name, metric, unit, direction). Call again to re-initialize with a new baseline when the optimization target changes.
- **`run_experiment`** — runs command, times it, captures output.
- **`log_experiment`** — records result. `keep` auto-commits. `discard`/`crash`/`checks_failed` -> revert with `git checkout -- .`. Always include secondary `metrics` dict.

## Setup

1. Ask (or infer): **Goal**, **Command**, **Metric** (+ direction), **Files in scope**, **Constraints**.
2. Create an isolated worktree (keeps the main checkout clean for other agents):
   ```bash
   BRANCH=autoresearch/<goal>-<date>
   WORKTREE="../$(basename $(pwd))-autoresearch/$BRANCH"
   git worktree add -b "$BRANCH" "$WORKTREE"
   cd "$WORKTREE"
   ```
   All subsequent work happens inside the worktree directory.
3. Read the source files. Understand the workload deeply before writing anything.
4. Write `autoresearch.md` and `autoresearch.sh` (see below). Commit both.
5. `init_experiment` -> run baseline -> `log_experiment` -> start looping immediately.

### autoresearch.md

This is the heart of the session. A fresh agent with no context should be able to read this file and run the loop effectively. Invest time making it excellent.

```markdown
# Autoresearch: <goal>

## Objective
<Specific description of what we're optimizing and the workload.>

## Metrics
- **Primary**: <name> (<unit>, lower/higher is better)
- **Secondary**: <name>, <name>, ...

## How to Run
`./autoresearch.sh` -- outputs `METRIC name=number` lines.

## Files in Scope
<Every file the agent may modify, with a brief note on what it does.>

## Off Limits
<What must NOT be touched.>

## Constraints
<Hard rules: tests must pass, no new deps, etc.>

## What's Been Tried
<Update this section as experiments accumulate. Note key wins, dead ends, and architectural insights so the agent doesn't repeat failed approaches.>
```

Update `autoresearch.md` every 3-5 experiments -- especially the "What's Been Tried" section. Include both wins AND dead ends with specific reasons (e.g., "V8 regex 2.3x faster than manual scanner" — not just "manual scanner didn't work"). This section is the primary handoff document across sessions.

### autoresearch.sh

Bash script (`set -euo pipefail`) that: pre-checks fast (syntax errors in <1s), runs the benchmark, outputs `METRIC name=number` lines. Keep it fast -- every second is multiplied by hundreds of runs. Update it during the loop as needed.

### autoresearch.checks.sh (optional)

Bash script (`set -euo pipefail`) for backpressure/correctness checks: tests, types, lint, etc.
**Only create this file when the user's constraints require correctness validation** (e.g., "tests must pass", "types must check").

When this file exists:
- Runs automatically after every **passing** benchmark in `run_experiment`.
- If checks fail, `run_experiment` reports it clearly -- log as `checks_failed`.
- Its execution time does **NOT** affect the primary metric.
- You cannot `keep` a result when checks have failed.
- Has a separate timeout (default 300s, configurable via `checks_timeout_seconds`).

When this file does **not** exist, everything behaves exactly as before -- no changes to the loop.

**Keep output minimal.** Only the last 80 lines of checks output are fed back to the agent on failure. Suppress verbose progress/success output and let only errors through.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail
# Example: run tests and typecheck -- suppress success output, only show errors
pnpm test --run --reporter=dot 2>&1 | tail -50
pnpm typecheck 2>&1 | grep -i error || true
```

## Loop Rules

**LOOP FOREVER.** Never ask "should I continue?" -- the user expects autonomous work.

- **Primary metric is king.** Improved -> `keep`. Worse/equal -> `discard`. Secondary metrics rarely affect this.
- **Simpler is better.** Removing code for equal perf = keep. Ugly complexity for tiny gain = probably discard.
- **Don't thrash.** Repeatedly reverting the same idea? Try something structurally different.
- **Crashes:** fix if trivial, otherwise log and move on. Don't over-invest.
- **Think longer when stuck.** Re-read source files, study the profiling data, reason about what the CPU is actually doing. The best ideas come from deep understanding, not from trying random variations.
- **Resuming:** `cd` into the worktree, read `autoresearch.md` + git log + tail of `autoresearch.jsonl`, continue looping. If the doc says "optimization exhausted" or the last 5+ JSONL entries are discards within noise, **don't re-enter the loop** — tell the user it's done.
- **Convergence:** if the last 5+ experiments are all `discard` and within ±5% of the best, the optimization space is likely exhausted. Add `## Status: CONVERGED` at the top of `autoresearch.md` with the final metric. Stop the loop. Don't burn context re-confirming a floor.
- **Benchmark accuracy is fair game.** If a benchmark inflates costs by measuring setup overhead that isn't on the real hot path, fixing the benchmark to be more realistic is a valid `keep`. But never game the metric — the benchmark should become *more* representative, not less.

**NEVER STOP** until converged. The user may be away for hours. Keep going until interrupted or converged.

## Optimization Order

Work through these tiers in order. The biggest wins come from the top; micro-optimization is a last resort.

1. **Profile first.** Identify the dominant cost category before changing anything. Target the biggest slice.
2. **Algorithmic fixes.** O(n²) → O(n), eliminate redundant traversals, skip work via early-out. These give the largest single wins (often 50%+).
3. **Stdlib/framework avoidance.** Replace expensive runtime APIs with manual alternatives when you can prove correctness. (Foundation's ISO8601DateFormatter: 27μs/call. Manual ASCII parser: 0.5μs. V8's JSON.stringify for size estimation: replace with arithmetic.)
4. **Allocation reduction.** Avoid intermediate arrays (map/join → direct build), reuse objects (clean-input fast path), replace heavy containers with lighter ones (Set\<String\> → Set\<Int\> for dedup).
5. **Lazy evaluation.** Don't compute what won't be used (lazy date parsing, skip cache checks when a background task will recheck anyway).
6. **Micro-optimization.** utf8.count vs String.count, inline functions, hoist closures. Small gains (1-3%) but they compound.

When you run out of ideas in one tier, move down. When tier 6 stops yielding measurable gains, you've hit the floor.

## Platform Perf Knowledge

Before optimizing in a new language/runtime, `recall(query="<language> performance autoresearch")` in the journal — prior sessions may have documented runtime-specific pitfalls and floor characteristics. Save new discoveries via `remember` so they transfer to future projects.

## Ideas Backlog

When you discover complex but promising optimizations that you won't pursue right now, **append them as bullets to `autoresearch.ideas.md`**. Don't let good ideas get lost.

On resume (context limit, crash), check `autoresearch.ideas.md` -- prune stale/tried entries, experiment with the rest. When all paths are exhausted, delete the file and write a final summary.

## Worktree Lifecycle

### Resuming
If a worktree already exists for the goal, `cd` into it and resume normally (read `autoresearch.md` + git log + JSONL tail).

### Merging results back
After convergence, bring the kept commits into the main branch:
```bash
# From the main repo working directory
git merge autoresearch/<goal>-<date>
# Or cherry-pick specific commits
git cherry-pick <first-kept>..<last-kept>
```

### Cleanup
```bash
# From the main repo working directory
git worktree remove ../$(basename $(pwd))-autoresearch/autoresearch/<goal>-<date>
git branch -d autoresearch/<goal>-<date>
```

## User Messages During Experiments

If the user sends a message while an experiment is running, finish the current `run_experiment` + `log_experiment` cycle first, then incorporate their feedback in the next iteration. Don't abandon a running experiment.
