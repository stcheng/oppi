# Onboarding and Pairing

All commands run from `server/`.

## First device

1. Start the server:

   ```bash
   cd server
   node dist/src/cli.js serve
   ```

   On first run, Oppi shows:
   - pairing QR code
   - invite link

2. Open Oppi on iPhone.

3. In onboarding, choose one:
   - **Scan QR Code**
   - **Paste Invite Link**

4. Confirm server trust.

5. Oppi opens **Workspaces**.

6. If the server has no workspaces, Oppi opens **Create Workspace**.

If your phone is not on the same LAN (for example Tailscale or VPS), generate an invite with an explicit host:

```bash
cd server
node dist/src/cli.js pair --host <hostname-or-ip>
```

Notes:

- `--host` must be host/IP only (no `https://`, no `:port`).
- Invite port comes from server config:

  ```bash
  node dist/src/cli.js config get port
  ```

- If clients must connect on a different port, set it first, restart `serve`, then generate a fresh invite:

  ```bash
  node dist/src/cli.js config set port <public-port>
  ```

## Additional devices

1. Generate a new invite:

   ```bash
   cd server
   node dist/src/cli.js pair
   ```

2. On the new phone, scan the QR code or paste the invite link.

## Invite rules

- Invite is single-use.
- Invite expires after 90 seconds by default.
- Invite includes server identity and transport details.

## Troubleshooting

### Invite expired or already used

1. Generate a new invite:

   ```bash
   cd server
   node dist/src/cli.js pair
   ```

2. Retry pairing immediately.

### Could not reach server

1. Confirm phone-to-server connectivity (LAN, Tailscale, or public DNS).

2. Check server health and config:

   ```bash
   cd server
   node dist/src/cli.js status
   node dist/src/cli.js doctor
   ```

3. Regenerate invite with explicit host:

   ```bash
   cd server
   node dist/src/cli.js pair --host <hostname-or-ip>
   ```

4. Retry pairing.

### Secure connection failed

1. Generate a fresh invite from the same server.

2. Retry pairing.

3. Do not edit invite content manually.
