/// - sessionId changes → view reused for a different session (onChange self-healing)
/// - generation changes → reconnect after network drop
///
/// Without sessionId in the key, two consecutive managers both start at
/// generation 0 — SwiftUI sees the same id and silently skips reconnection
/// for the new session, leaving the timeline blank.
